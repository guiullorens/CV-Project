# CV-Project

--Project Analysis--

- Target user profile
  
This project is based on making my curriculum vitae, so it can be addressed to the person in charge of a company in which I am interested in working.
In it you can find a summary of my skills and characteristics summarised in seven main parts: a brief presentation of my person that serves to make myself known in a brief and summarised way. A section where I leave my contacts so that communication can continue in the future. Another section where I leave my hobbies and interests so that even more can be known about me. There are also two sections that summarize my professional career: work experience and education. Finally you can find a section where you can see the languages I am able to communicate in and another one where you can see my specific skills in my field of computer science.

- Information architecture
  
The project information is mainly divided into three columns with 2 sections each. In them you can find text paragraphs that allow to explain the most relevant information about me, as well as images to facilitate the comprehension and improve the visual aspect.

- Visual design
  
The project has mainly used three different colours in the text: grey, red and black. With these three colours and the typography "Roboto" it was enough to achieve a simple but elegant look. This has been achieved also thanks to the distribution of the space, which is divided by lines, creating a main row at the top in which a brief presentation of me is given and in which you can also see a picture of me. Below this row there are 3 columns in which the six sections containing more specific information about me are developed. In addition, the images that have been added have also helped to make the overall look and feel of the CV more pleasant, and to make it clearer. 
I would also like to add that in order to design the final result I have taken examples of CVs that have served as inspiration and ideas to make my final design.
